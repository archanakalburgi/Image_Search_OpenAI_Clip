# Vector Searching
- [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)
    - Annoying part is, it is based on a file. 
    - And that file needs to be shipped around and vectors cannot be added on fly. Which is good and bad.
    - I have used this before, it is simple to use no complicated setup.
- [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
    - Looks like the vectors can be added on fly.
    - Might not be great 
- [Hnsw](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib)
    - Very similar to annoy, with added bonus of being able to add vectors on fly.
    - This might be a good fit for what goals I have with this project.  
    - Wish to get a prototype of this.
- [Scann](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann)
    - Readme says it supports linux primarily.
    - I have a mac and did not investigate this
